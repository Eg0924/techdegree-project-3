Interactive Form
Lines 164-175 I have created an event listener to activate on keyup and validate whether the name field is empty or not. If the name field goes empty a message activates saying that the field cannot be blank.

Zip Code Validation

On lines 209-220 I checked the Zipcode field to see if it was empty and displayed a message indicating the field was empty. Then if the field was not empty and not valid, a different message was displayed stating 5 digits were needed.
